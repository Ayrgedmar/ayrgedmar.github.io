Map objective

Maps were designed mainly for sniper positions, with players who like to play mid- and close-range combat.

The reference card was chosen from the mobile game World War Heroes - Finland map. From it we built expectations on gameplay.

For the visual component was chosen Suburb LA, the main referents were taken from GTA V.



Plan and reference


The reference card was chosen from the mobile game World War Heroes - Finland map. From it we built expectations on gameplay.

The LA suburb was chosen for the visual component, the main referents were taken from the GTA V. In the role of a memorable element was chosen the fallen aircraft, but by the middle of the work it was abandoned due to the difficult implementation.

From the lighting were selected photos with the desired result, and as the main element - the mountains.

--------

Gray Box


It was decided to make a difference of heights, so that you can make points from which you can see most of the map.

Closer to the middle, narrower passageways for melee were designed. In the center, an arena was planned for more active battles.

 

After a series of playlists the map became smaller, the capture points moved closer to the center.

----------

After playlists and work iterations, snipers' heights, middle battles, and houses served as close encounters, shelters, and spawning.

Final geometry with artwork:

(Spawns red, passageways white, and capture points blue)

Art

So we finally found the right points and moved on to the artwork.

Saving the main logical places, I chose the style of the map, came up with the design and modeled the house, landscape, street.

Three new textures were used for T3.
For the referents, I picked up some screenshots from GTA V. From the general feeling and the lighting on the map, I found a photographer and selected some suitable works.

----------

On the background I chose 2d photos, Photoshopped to match the colors of the map and laid out.

---------

Optimization


In terms of performance, the card was fairly well designed and showed a good number of droplets for the mobile project, despite its large open spaces (on average Tris : 200k)


This was achieved by a small kolic props and a relatively simple (low polygonal) architecture of buildings.

---------

Results

By the end of the work on the playing card with the main weapon, several problems were revealed:


-The map turned out to be too open, the height of the fences and shelters in general was not enough to fence the required space. Players immediately hit the open space from several levels of the card.

-Poor readability of the environment, loss of orientation in the space when leaving the spawn points.

-Debating place - Central road. Too open and unsafe place.


How the problem was solved:

 

-Raised the fence level

-Cleared the backround of extra geometry

-In the future, insist on a minimalist map art (increase readability without cutting art)
