Reference

Brutalism was chosen as the map style, as in the previous map. This style is easily used to decorate the location.

Grassyknoll from UT 2004 in a similar style and the famous Face card in some gameplay techniques were also chosen as inspiration.

Gray Box


The whole base was built of mesh with markings, so as not to disturb the metrics of the game. 

I figured out the escape routes after capturing the flag and the points for the sniper.

Strategic and tactical elements

First track

The fastest, but passes in open terrain. If the sniper stands, it will be difficult to get out. You can turn left or right so you dont turn 180 degrees.

----

Second track

Safer. I’ve set the corners so that the view of the running player is permanently cut off. And the gate only opens on one side so the enemy can’t get in. However, a running player can be expected from the other side of the gate, so you can see an ambush through the window. And then there’s the open ground, but you can get through it much faster. There is already playing a variety of tactics on the part of the team - whether the whole team sniper or ambush or distract attention.

----

Third way

Not so safe, but there are first aid kits. You can also enlarge the path and go from the back to the sniper, bypass it and exit from the other side. And you can jump right into the flag from the secret hole in the floor. 

I deliberately lifted the mesh and removed the vegetation to isolate this area.

Sniper tower

The view here is completely free up to the entrance, but also the sniper is unprotected, which balances his location. The sniper also sees an enemy sniper, which can help protect his team. I closed the view of the point of the flag so that the escapee could be stopped, but it took a split second and teamwork.

-----


Flag arrangement

The flag is fenced with a gate to give the running player a chance to escape. This balances open areas to the exit. I removed the mesh from the ceiling so that players could see that there was something they could do from the top, or they could just notice it.

-----

Buffer zone

Here I gave a few options to escape. As usual, the fastest - the most open. The point of interest is a first aid kit to which you need to run for a long time in an open space.

----

Visual design

I used concrete bases to match the style and simplicity of visual design. Plus the relatively white space makes players stand out. 

 

To give the player a good sense of direction in the space I added contrast decals, arrows and various details on the walls and floor. It also created a sense of "vitality" in the location.

 

To optimize the light I used Light Impotens Value.
