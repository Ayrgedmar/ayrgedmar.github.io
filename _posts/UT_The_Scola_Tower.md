References

The Scola Tower was chosen as the reference location. This castle, in my opinion, was ideal in terms of the dynamics of transitions between the sections. This will force the player to move constantly, changing his location to look behind each corner, creating a movement dynamic.

<h2>Gray Box</h2>

For the base location were used meshi with markings, which are initially stored in assetas. Each wall and floor were measured using these auxiliary meshes to preserve the metrics on the map.


Then I moved the basic geometry from the reference building, after which I completed it with the missing elements that were required for full gameplay and location completeness.


These were the additional stairs, the passages, the back of the building. After constant game iterations, some locations were completed on the map and an additional lower floor was added.


I wanted not only dynamic transitions between rooms (horizontal part), but also between floors (vertical part). I also wanted to achieve dynamics between open and closed space, light and dark.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<h4>Arenas</h4>

The arenas are open areas where players will clash. They are located in the basement, in the backyard in both parts and in the main part of the map. Everywhere there are weapons or first aid kits as points of attraction.  This will enhance the effect of flow and motivation of constant movement on the location.

<h4>Sniper tower</h4>

The sniper tower is positioned so that you can see from both sides. The height gives an excellent view, but this place is very open and the sniper can be easily removed.

<h4>Cellar</h4>

The basement is the most closed room, it gives a little respite from the open spaces.

<h2>Visual design</h2>

The idea for visual design came of itself. It was decided to do the same Scola Tower, but not in the sea, and around the rocks.

The open space and the enclosed blend harmoniously in colors - cold blue and warm yellow.

To optimize the light I used Light Impotens Value.
