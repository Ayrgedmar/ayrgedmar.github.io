Reference

Brutalism was chosen as the map style. These are concrete, massive minimalist buildings.  Some details were chosen for inspiration, which I partially implemented on the map.

----

Gray Box

The whole base was built of mesh with markings, so as not to disturb the metrics of the game. 

 

To begin with, I built several floors in a chaotic order and created simple transitions between them. Constantly replaying the level I added, changed and tried to improve these transitions between the sections, trying to keep the momentum.

 

In the end, I achieved some general level shape and style concepts that matched my vision. I tried to improve navigation on the level by adding through spaces and curved shapes.

Gameplay

Some types of weapons, cartridges were selected and placed on the map so as not to interrupt the flow states and to force the player to move on the map, creating fights between the players.

Visual design


â€‹I used concrete bases to match the style and simplicity of visual design. Plus the relatively white space makes players stand out.
