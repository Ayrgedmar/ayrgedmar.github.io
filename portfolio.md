<h3>Highlights</h3>

<a href="../data/showcase/CGMA_Gig">CGMA CP2077 Gig:New Attendant</a>

For my course project, I created a location for Cyberpunk 2077

<a href="../data/showcase/CGMA_Station">CGMA Sci-Fi Station</a>

The location features gameplay mechanics, a small quest, and original narrative â€” all designed and assembled in two weeks

A full-scale (first) commercial-quality environment created from greybox to final art (modeling, texturing, lighting, etc.)

My favorite creative project, made before I began my professional career
