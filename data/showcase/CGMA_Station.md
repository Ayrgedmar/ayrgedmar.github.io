This level was created as part of the CGMA course under the mentorship of Max Pears.

General Description
This level was built around the theme “Station on a Planet.” As part of the course, we were asked to develop a small narrative, starting with a general description of an open-world location and to create an initial exterior blockout. We were then tasked with designing the station’s interior, incorporating gameplay elements.

Since the general structure was created first and the interior and gameplay were added later (instead of the other way around), this made the task more challenging.

Location Overview
The level is set at a Water Purification Station on a colonized planet.
The main reference was a map from Mass Effect.

Mission:
Investigate why the station has stopped responding to communications.

Additional assignment requirement:
From this location, the player should be able to see four other landmarks in the open world.

The building consists of four floors.

First Floor – Introduction

Introduces interaction with objects

First encounter with an enemy

Second Floor – First Challenge

Light enemy presence

First puzzle element

Third Floor – Escalation

More enemies

The player can see the boss on the lower floor and begin to prepare for the encounter

Live NPCs can be found and interacted with

Preparation Option:
The player can either:

Fight directly through to the boss in a straightforward combat challenge

Explore the station and activate triggers that weaken the boss

Fourth Floor – Final Challenge

A few enemies at the last preparation checkpoint

Final Boss fight

Final Boss:
The boss is placed on high ground with multiple cover spots.
There is an option to sneak to a safer elevated area.
The high ground itself is inaccessible but destructible by the boss.
