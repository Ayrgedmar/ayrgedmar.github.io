This level was created as part of the CGMA course under the mentorship of Max Pears.

<h2>General Description</h2>

This level was built around the theme “Station on a Planet.” As part of the course, we were asked to develop a small narrative, starting with a general description of an open-world location and to create an initial exterior blockout. We were then tasked with designing the station’s interior, incorporating gameplay elements.

Since the general structure was created first and the interior and gameplay were added later (instead of the other way around), this made the task more challenging.

<h2>Location Overview</h2>

The level is set at a Water Purification Station on a colonized planet.
The main reference was a map from Mass Effect.
