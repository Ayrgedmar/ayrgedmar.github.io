Map objective

The aim of the map was to create dynamic gameplay.
Overwatch cards and other shooter arenas were studied for reference.
The visual reference was taken from Spider-Man - a mission on the roof of a building under construction, and the CS - Vertigo map.

Grey Box

Based on the reference elements, I built a map with varying heights, necks and discoveries parts, leaving space for campering and different mechanics.

Since the project introduced the jump mechanics, I decided to use it on the map - left places to jump on to get.  Tried to alternate open and closed spaces, as well as places where you can shoot, but you can not pass to increase the variability of strategies for players.

-------

One of the main elements wanted to leave the bridge and the room where the main fight will be.

 

I tried to leave the bullet holes for and the camping space.

-------

After several playoffs and iterations the card has become less rolled and dynamic, which is more suitable for our players.
