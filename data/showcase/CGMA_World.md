This level was created as part of the CGMA course under the mentorship of Max Pears.

<h2>Location Overview</h2>

This level was made as part of the course presets assignment.
I simply enjoyed working on something like this. I created themed islands and placed chests throughout them.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<ul> 
<li>Objective:</li>
</ul> 
Collect all the chests and make your way to the Castle.

Chest searching is simple, and the exploration of paths to other islands is indirect but still relaxed. Players can either take a quicker route or find all 8.

The first steps let the player test out the jump and flight mechanics so they can use them comfortably.

I also added some artistic touches to enhance emotions—for example, flight is subtly supported by ships.

I deliberately created a cliff so that the player can experience the sensation of falling over an edge.

The final island is the lowest one. There, the player needs to make their way to the end, where a portal awaits—this is the only path to the Castle.

<h2>Design</h2>

The islands are arranged in such a way that the player's gaze is drawn to focal points, leading upward—toward the main goal.

VFX in the form of a "breeze" are placed throughout the map to guide the player toward objectives.

Each "zone" is enclosed by a collider. When the player crosses it (or a killZ), they are returned to the nearest portal. Since the player can fly indefinitely, this limits their movement.
