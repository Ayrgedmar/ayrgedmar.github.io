This level was created as part of the CGMA course under the mentorship of Max Pears.

General Description
This level was made as part of the course presets assignment.
I simply enjoyed working on something like this. I created themed islands and placed chests throughout them.

Objective:
Collect all the chests and make your way to the Castle.
