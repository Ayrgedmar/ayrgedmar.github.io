<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create linked, full-featured locations</li>
<li>Learn the engine</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reference</h2>
​
It was inspired by the location from Fable III DLC "Understone Quest Pack" - Subglushville. All visual decisions were made without referents, based on their own ideas about location.

<h2>Blockout</h2>
​
Since the engine does not provide the basic types of meshes, I used the pieces of the location and arranged them so that they create the approximate desired geometry.

After the basic geometry was done, I began to stitch the mesh.

That’s what I did in each of the three locations.

<h3>location</h3>

I made a molecular plan of the gameplay of the whole location, which was followed by the decision to divide the whole map into three sections:

<ul>
<li>Settlement itself</li>
<li>Labyrinth</li>
<li>Gorge</li>
</ul>

​Next I collected the location, starting from the entrance. When I started the main part, I positioned Landmark to see the composition and feel the size of the location.

 
I also calculated the height at which the player was able to break. It was necessary for the player to not be able to walk on the bottom - this was not part of my plans, as it significantly expanded the playing space, which is not really necessary in the given conditions. 

​
At home, I put it on more than one plane to create the dynamics of the composition.

On locations I focused three important points:

<ul>
<li>Waterfall - the main landmark</li>
<li>The Main House - a plot important element</li>
<li>An Enclosed Entrance to the Gorge is a plot hook that would force the player to try to scout the location</li>
</ul>

I’ve arranged several "secret" locations to reward the player for his research and liven up the area.

That’s why I put supplies and a vegetable garden next to the house.

I placed the sound so that the source was somewhere around the waterfall, not spread everywhere.

<h3>Houses</h3>

I found an exterior mesh of a house in Skyrome and copied the interior.

After that, I removed all the contents and began to build houses based on the professional activities and features of the character who lived there.

Set up the lights, and so on in every house.

<h3>Labyrinth</h3>


The direction of the maze I was making on the condition that it was a passage from the house to the ravine. 

So that the player does not get confused I raised the level of the ground several times, closer to the exit.

In the game "Alice in the Land of Nightmares" in the maze you could navigate by enemies - if you come across an enemy, then this road is new. And I did the same thing here - I put my enemies closer to the exit, the closer, the bigger the pile.

<h3>Gorge</h3>

The gorge I made based on the idea of some ancient place.

This is where I put the entrance to the settlement, that door, near the waterfall, and the exit to Skyrim, for convenience. 

I arranged the bridge so that the player could immediately notice it and realize that it could be jumped and passed.

<h3>Entry and exit</h3>

The entrance and exit I planned where in the world there are waterfalls. This should preserve the logic of the place. 

Both are located in a rock that looks organic. 

 
Exit is not marked with a marker and you cannot enter without a key - the player will not be able to start from the last location. I made it look like a panoramic view of Skyrim.

<h2>Enemies</h2>
 
I’ve positioned my enemies based on this schedule of complexity.
<ul>
<li>In the beginning for the priming I have positioned enemies who are killed with one blow.</li>
<li>In the Labyrinth, there are five medium enemies and at the end there is the Boss.</li>
<li>In the Gorge, I put one Boss in a lighter position, because the most stressful part I wanted to do was in the Labyrinth. Then the Gorge will be especially pleasant for the player.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Optimizing</h2>

To optimize, I have broken down all the locations to load only what the player sees. 

In the area of lighting we managed to achieve good optimization in almost all locations. Somewhere the red zones had to be left, but this should not affect the overall performance. 


The mod was successfully launched on a weak laptop and on medium settings.
