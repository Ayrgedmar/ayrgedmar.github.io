<h4>Lead Level designer</h4>
Oct 2024 - Apr 2025

As a Lead Level Designer, I participated in the hiring process and managed both junior and mid-level designers. I was involved in developing the company’s map production pipeline, overseeing team members and planning their tasks. I handled both organizational and technical challenges—not only within the Level Design department but also in collaboration with Game Design, Lighting/Art, Narrative, Sound Design, and Programming teams. I wrote level design requirements and created internal documentation for the department.

<li>Planning</li>
<li>Management</li>
<li>Coordinated pipeline synchronization across departments</li>
<li>Design workflow optimization through art-side features</li>
</ul>
